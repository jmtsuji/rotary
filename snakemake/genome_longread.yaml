## Long read QC
# Minimum read length
minlength: 1000
# Minimum average quality (PHRED) score. Q13 is ~5% expected error rate.
minavgquality: 13

## Assembly
# nano-hq (if <5% error) or nano-raw
flye_input_mode: "nano-hq"
# Run Flye in --meta mode? (True or False, no quotation marks)
flye_meta_mode: False
# By default, Flye performs one round of long read polishing after assembly
flye_polishing_rounds: 1

## Polishing
# Can set to any model supported by medaka
medaka_model: "r941_min_sup_g507"

## Post-polishing contig filter
# Note: Short reads are used for the filter if short reads are provided; otherwise long reads are used.
#       The logic here is that long reads alone can't (currently) remove all errors from genomes, so short reads
#       are preferred for the final polish if they are available.
# Only contigs with this or greater mean read depth will be kept (e.g., 10x)
meandepth_cutoff: 10
# Only contigs with this or greater % of bases covered by reads will be kept (e.g., 95%)
evenness_cutoff: 95
